<H1>Audrey Barrow</H1>
<p>PA to Caroline Sheers</p>
<p>Interviewed on 13/9/2001 at New Broad Street<br>
Present: Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<h2>How do you spend your working time?</h2>
<p>Mostly normal working hours &#151; sometimes longer if Caroline needs it</p>
<h3>Diary management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Handles all diary changes.
<li>Very dynamic. Just switching over to an electronic diary (as of 17/9) [how is she doing with it now?]
<li>80% of bookings requested by Caroline; 20% in response to requests from other people.
<li>Requests mostly dealt with by phone – “I prefer to speak to people – [if you send e-mail, for example,] you don’t know if they’re there.”
<li>60% of meetings internal, 40% with external people (but depends on current projects)
</ul>

<h3>Telephoning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Making calls.
<li>Answering calls and putting them through to Caroline if appropriate.
<li>Caroline leaves voicemail messages for Audrey. The other way, Audrey can usually track Caroline down.
</ul>

<h3>E-mails</h3>
<ul>
<li>Access to Caroline’s inbox.
<li>Reads e-mails; prints off key ones and walks hands them to Caroline (“have you seen this?”) or just draws attention to them verbally
<li>Deals with meeting requests (can send e-mail pp Caroline)
<li>When Caroline is away, reads e-mails over the phone and/or prints them and faxes them (“Caroline tends to use her [laptop] when away, but it never works” – Audrey says she has never received an e-mail from Caroline when remote).
</ul>

<h2>What could be better about your job?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quite happy.
<li>Could work more for the team [M&A team?], but don’t have time, and there isn’t enough work to have two people for Caroline to give Audrey the space.
<li>“Caroline likes an ‘old fashioned’ secretary, but would like me to me more ‘techy’”
</ul>

<h2>What do you think are Caroline’s issues?</h2>
<ul>
<li>She tends to lose everything, so a one-piece machine (ie, without any cables, adaptors, etc.) would be a boon.
<li>Sitting close together [with other group directors] would/will be good.
<li>“I think we’re getting an iPaq”
<li>“Caroline is more techy than I; probably knows more”
</ul>

<h2>Other points</h2>
<h3>Kim’s PA group</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not much use really. Has no authority. Is never realistically going to get everyone together. “Just an excuse for a load of women to sit around with coffee and biscuits.”
</ul>
