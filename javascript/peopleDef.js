Finds it �a bit flaky�, and would like better access to the Internet when on the road.<li>Likes working with ideas using pen and paper � would like some form of electronic transcription.<li>Would like to be alerted when chosen Web sites change.<li>Likes video conferencing (because it gives more personal contact) <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> would like PC<font face=symbol>&#171;</font>PC video conferencing (PR: we�re doing a pilot of that � although it�s too bad to use yet; they�re considering a private transatlantic link that should make it easier).<li>MAKE IT WORK! (eg, 4 failures in last week: no e-mail for one week while traveling; couldn�t order �Clicks@Home� PC over the Web; a video conference with John Baxter and Nick Baldwin failed; couldn�t fill in the staff survey (crashed browser!))<li>The [Group Director] group is fragmented (mixture of Westwood, London and US); not optimised for easy communication.�I bump into people at random � you only communicate on the basis of need.� Better communication would allow engineering to be more involved in the discussion of corporate direction.</ul><H2>Group function</H2><ul><li>Two main functions - Group engineering policy (helping to manage assets effectively) and Research.</ul><H3>Group Engineering Policy</H3><ul><li>Carries out a regular review (�not quite an audit�) of the engineering assets <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> takes a �sideways look� at what�s going on, independently of line management.<li>The aim is to set a structure for policy without being too prescriptive. They have a small number of prescriptive minimum engineering standards (eg, how to handle pulverised fuels), mostly around safety, and otherwise containing policy framework documents (advisory documentation � �almost a knowledge base�).<li>John has appointed a new manager for this as part of his team; she is part of LG&E and is based in the US. She manages the process of policy production, and also the annual plant status  review process (sometimes funded by the business; sometimes funded by the group).The master copies of policies should be available on the intranet (nearly there, if not actually there).</ul><H3>Research</h3><ul><li>Chris runs this. He is the purchaser of R&D, and sets the themes for it. He has an R&D budget to spend; his largest supplier is the �Power Technology Centre� (PTC), which is part of Powergen (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> who runs that?). He also does technology tracking. Much of what they do is �very far from blue sky � it�s almost service activity that the assets won�t pay for.�<li>Engineering R&D �underpins the necessary engineering expertise/competency within the company�. Can be bought in, but sometimes it needs to be in the business (eg, in order to provide expertise for litigation). Some (most) of it does this; some of it looks way into the future at things they think might be significant.<li>External links are important (they provide a �technology window on the world�).  For example, <a href=\"http://www.epri.com\" target=_new>EPRI</a> (US) and <a href=\"http://www.vgb-power.de\" target=_new>VGB</a> (Germany) are professional bodies to which Powergen is affiliated. There is no real common model for dealing with external organisations � it depends on the organisation.<li>There is a �sort of� rolling three-year R&D plan. The plan is reviewed annually, but R&D projects tend to be most effective when they last about three years. Thus, each year, Chris has to decide whether to allocate the next year of funding for each project that�s on-going, as well as starting new ones.<li>There is a very large range of issues and technologies: The PTC has ~250 people, which roughly equates to 250 specialities.<li>Businesses also do R&D, but they have a very short-term focus (it�s not often not quite �proper� R&D � more like technical service activity with a novel edge). Businesses will tend to act locally (by doing their own work or buying solutions) to solve their own business problems. Limited dialogue.<li>Group engineering organises �one major brainstorming jamboree� per year in the US and the UK.<li>Collaborative ventures are increasingly common. They reckon to achieve a 30% spending leverage on collaborative ventures (in fact 4:1 financial gearing; 10:1 IP gearing). Almost all collaborative activities are done at the corporate level. They are keen on them, but there are trade-offs that prevent them sometimes (commercial confidentiality; the sheer effort of bidding; the number of discussions that don�t get anywhere).<li>All output documents from R&D available on the R&D intranet; can send e-mails with links to reports on it.</ul><H2>Other Issues</H2><H3>Current R&D Intranet</H3><ul><li>Quite extensive (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> need to see it + what�s the CMS?);<li>No access control (beyond standard Powergen security <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> issues with users from US at the moment).<li>Contains policy master copies, R&D documentation, including the outputs of seminars (eg, the recent Louisville seminar on combustion) with presentations.<li>CG concerned about storage requirements, and download times.<li>Would like to be able to partition the site (some public information; some corporate only; some group only) <font face=symbol>&#174;</font> PR pointed out that you can do that already<li>Would like an �easy route� for publishing documents to the site (currently done by shared PA Mary Mulligan).</ul><H3>Reaction To Preparatory Questions</H3><ul><li>Thought the idea of putting personal objectives up to be �a bit strong�, although a fan of business objectives (on probing, agreed he was more concerned with �personal development�-type objectives).<li>There are definitely issues of confidentiality (eg, a turbine failure in the US might involve challenging the manufacturer in court, which would require confidentiality).<li>Wrt technology, observed that US managers had pagers to provide a certain level of connectivity. Perceived a danger in things like active memory and smart signs that it would cause �too much bureaucracy� (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> why?).<li>Likes LG&E�s people directory with pictures, to allow you to put a face to the name (PR said �something similar� is being done here <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> get details of internal projects).</ul>"],

For example, it�s not easy casually to discuss an M&A possibility within the whole group. M&A, Finance and legal, both being in London, will all discuss. We need �a level of communication and cohesion beyond [the] strictly necessary.�<li>The group should be together, and it should not be co-located within the UK business. The US is a big issue in this � it will grow much faster (particularly with E.ON); could end up with a split UK/US site and/or US �imports� (eg, John Baxter�s US manager).<li>Personally: with Nick Baldwin; with MDs of US and UK (largely UK � need to address this bias); Carol Wood; Caroline Shears.

Now there�s a parent (which must add value), and UK and US businesses; BUT initial creation of parent/corporate team very unclear, because the parent has the same name/branding as the UK retail business, is co-located with it and therefore is unhealthily close.<li>One role of the parent is to manage the transfer of expertise (eg, about working in a deregulating market) to (eg,) the US.<li>Nick�s memo to the �leadership group� (�top 30�) [who are they?] [can we have the memo � ref.

How about an intranet for the �top 30�?

Software needs to interface well with others; synchronising large downloads is a problem.</ul><H2>Relations with group directors</H2><ul><li>During deals, co-ordinates the group decision markers (CEO, CFO etc.) to make sure that they come together properly.</ul><H2>Group Function</H2><ul><li>Powergen�s strategy is based on acquisition and integration.<li>Big deals are done corporately by Caroline and a small team; this team interacts with group-level people at a strategy level, with a bigger group drawn from the businesses do due diligence, advisors and people from the target.<li>Above all, they produce an �acquisition case�, following which there is a transaction and then integration.<li>Disposals are normally done through an auction involving 15-30 bidders, and involve M&A team interaction with the business to be sold.<li>Caroline�s team acts as a hub and coordinates that activity; they are �very much the �doers� in the group.�<li>The ideas is to make a team that delivers the whole thing from concept to transaction to putting in a management team [<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> due diligence team becomes management team(?)]<li>M&A needs to be kept close to the group (ie, centralised), with only simple deals devolved to individual businesses (although the central team would still act as an advisor).<li>There is a need to keep track of M&A expertise within individuals across the businesses.<li>M&A deals involve huge amounts of data and (often) unusual hours. The team needs access to data 24 hours a day and the ability to move its working set from between sites.<li>Currently they�re only �at the very beginning of� electronic networked data rooms (eg, DealBench); for security reasons, documents should not be printed[/printable?]. In a paper world, management of the data room is done manually to restrict access to the data.<li>Currently using an electronic system (although not DealBench) for one of the disposals in the US.<li>Deals in the US are done in a different way [which?].<li>Coordination of the due-diligence team (eg, 30 people for LG&E deal): they�ve introduced shared risk registers [On line? How managed?]; the full-time team (7 people) gives the due diligence team a list of questions to go away and answer; they use consultants, but they manage them (rather than the other way around) and they don�t rely on others for the transactions.<li>They need to pull together due diligence teams �at the drop of a hat, from across the businesses.� It takes 2/3 weeks to get a due diligence team up and running (computers, telephones, software, co-location etc.)<li>[So far] they haven�t lost a deal because of time � �you just do what you can to get it done�. LG&E deal took 8 weeks.<li>What training can be done for M&A? Very little, as it�s so generic. Experience is key (hence the need to track it). Need to have a very strong co-ordinator; need to have the team co-located; need common (eg, risk) registers. �It�s a very rewarding process because it combines specialist expertise with significant business judgement.�<li>Because of US �change of control� contracts (�nightmare�) you can�t rely on people still being around after a deal <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> all the knowledge and learning gained during the transaction is not necessarily brought into the running of the business afterwards. In big transactions, managing people through the process is critical <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> it is important to set up some people who will move from participation in due diligence through to integration � a motivation for on-going success.</ul>"],

Even heads of businesses don�t necessarily appreciate the value � it is felt locally, but not at that [high] level.<li>Introducing a corporate centre performance report that goes to the executive once a quarter.<li>Trouble is that there�s no overview. For example, an M&A occurring will be reported (separately) in the tax report, the HR report, the legal report etc. Given the structure, this is necessary, but it makes it look like self-justification. Shrinking the corporate centre may help with this, because with a lower density of activity the communication would be more focused (eg, around the M&A transaction, demonstrating performance against targets for the various functions).<li>Currently a lot of data flow is business <font face=symbol>&#174;</font> centre � the centre is not so good at sharing. Very few see the performance report, and so cannot comment on findings within it. Ideally, more should be shared with the �top team� of 30 people. At the moment they don�t get to see what their input helps to make (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> lack of personal satisfaction, both by those supplying the content and Carol and her team who make the report); they don�t get to see �the big picture�. For example, Carol�s report contains, among other things, the top 10 risks for the business � all of the �top 30� should know them.<li>People perceive the things that have to go to the centre (eg, investment decisions) as bureaucratic (eg, �[If] I give procedure X to the UK business, then they should communicate it. If they don�t, but just �overlay� it on their own plans, it looks like �it�s all the group�s fault.�)</ul><H3>Evolution Of Processes</H3><ul><li>Monthly reporting does evolve (eg, as Powergen becomes a truly Anglo-American organisation), but timescales are so short that there�s not much time for discussion.<li>Annual planning: there is more opportunity for creativity because the timescales are more relaxed.</ul><H3>Other Issues</H3><ul><li>Three types of user suggested - Mobile phone (Peter H, Jonathan Hodgkin), mobile + email + document review (Nick Baldwin, David Jackson), mobile phone + full computing environment (Carol Wood, Caroline Shears, Maureen Vevers)</ul>"],
