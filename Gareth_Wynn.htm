<H1>Gareth Wynn</H1>
<p>Group Director, Corporate Communications</p>
<p>Interviewed on 6/9/2001 at New Broad Street<br>
Present: Paul Rutter (Powergen); John Wilson and Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Personal</H2>

<ul>
<li>Needs to be able to &#147;get into Powergen systems (e-mail, shared drives) from anywhere, without necessarily carrying a laptop&#148;;
<li>Needs strong communication with team (eg, through increasing use of videoconferencing);
<li>Needs good communication with press, but their technology adoption is generally very low (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> faxing from the desktop may be useful).
</ul>

<H2>Relations with group directors</H2>
<ul>
<li>“[they need to] be more receptive to change… [we need to] agree values and then stick to them – act like we mean them – …if everyone goes back into their silos and doesn’t change behaviour, it won’t work.”
<li>Response to issues: phone call to Nick Baldwin, Peter Hickson and David Jackson, plus heads of UK and US businesses if necessary.
<li>Informal and goal-oriented working methods (eg, if you need to talk to someone, go and see her/him) – better way of working, but doesn’t help standing among colleagues.
<li>Training in handling broadcast media infrequent, involving professional newscaster <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> could use more modular, at-desk “refresher” training)
</ul>

<H2>Group Function</H2>
<ul><li>Largely consists of two functions - Reactive (responding to issues) and Proactive (planning and PR training):
</ul>

<H3>Reactive</H3>
<ul>
<li>Coordinating function – managing the escalation of issues through the businesses <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> delegate to business communications functions and educate them about what is “share price sensitive” (to make GW’s increasing proportion of travel time – especially on aircraft when he is out of touch – less of a problem).
<li>“I add value when the shit’s hitting the fan”
<li>Intelligence comes from: net alerts (aware, although not clear how much actually used) and broadcast monitoring (eg, Reuters) <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> have asked Infonic to suggest a couple of “nuggets” of deeper knowledge by way of illustration of the possibilities of smarter Internet monitoring.
<li>On the output side: uses a fulfilment house (United News Media) to do bulk faxing <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> could save money  by faxing press releases directly.
<li>All press releases go out on the Web and on the intranet.
</ul>
<H3>Proactive</H3>
<ul>
<li>Training in media relations (see group directors section above);
<li>No consolidated communications plan, but GW “trusted to distil what the businesses need”;
<li>Plan for individual campaigns and act as a coordinator for release (cf. Barclays disaster, where three perfectly reasonable plans were executed at the same time, creating a very bad effect).
</ul>
<H2>Other Issues</H2>
<ul>
<li>Random Idea - Decentralisation in reverse; stop the businesses from replicating functions that should be done within the group.
<li>Measurement should be communicated to the organisation - Amount of press releases; coverage of Powergen’s community initiatives; share of coverage.
<li>E.ON - Currently GW speaks three of four times per week but meets about once per month; “Keen but backward” (eg, enthusiastic response to, and consequent wish to replicate, Clicks@home initiative; “enthusiastic pockets” of activity)
<li>Internal Communications - Sharing best practice; mechanisms for group (eg, delivering the same (consistent) message in different ways); helping an understanding of the “big picture”.
