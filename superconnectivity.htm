<h2>Super connectivity</h2>
<p>Super connectivity is an approach to “smart” working for groups and teams. It is a framework of principles that can be used both as a diagnostic and as planning aid for new initiatives.</p>
<p>The principles are based around two types of connections:
<ul>
<li><b>Predictable connections</b> are those that we make intentionally. These include searching for information; receiving updates of information relevant to our work; communicating within our teams and with other individuals (in meetings and remotely); collaborating on work.</li>
<li><b>Unpredictable connections</b> are those that happen by chance. These include lateral thinking; <i>ad hoc</i> involvement in work; coming upon something valuable from simply browsing. Unpredictable connections are the powerhouse of innovation, and often a source of real insight.</li>
</ul>
