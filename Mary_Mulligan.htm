<H2>Notes</H2>
<ul>
<li>Mary has little or no interaction with anyone within Powergen. Her remit is engineering group based. She and John have worked together for 3 years and have always used technology. Laptops and Psion. They are completely self sufficient but would like the Powergen infrastructure to be more simple, to stay up more than it does AND TO BE MORE UP-TO-DATE.
