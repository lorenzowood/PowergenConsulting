<H1>Chris Green</H1>
<p>Works with John Baxter (Chief Engineer)</p>
<p>Interviewed on 6/9/2001 at Westwood (by videoconference from New Broad Street)<br>
Present: Paul Rutter (Powergen); John Wilson and Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Personal</H2>
<ul>
<li>Both Chris Green and John Baxter are UK based but travel frequently to the US.
<li>Use appropriate technology (eg, LG&E’s new clippings arrive via e-mail but are very slow to use because you end up having to sort through filenames – old paper system which much better as it was easy to flick through and had a top sheet with headlines and summaries).
<li>More like a “type II” person from the preparatory questionnaire – happy to use stuff, but not interested in being a trailblazer and ironing out the problems.
<li>Likes and uses open calendars.
<li>Doesn’t like wires on a desk – would like everything to be wireless.
<li>Thinks himself to be a “typical mobile user”: mobile phone + light laptop. Finds it “a bit flaky”, and would like better access to the Internet when on the road.
<li>Likes working with ideas using pen and paper – would like some form of electronic transcription.
<li>Would like to be alerted when chosen Web sites change.
<li>Likes video conferencing (because it gives more personal contact) <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> would like PC<font face=symbol>&#171;</font>PC video conferencing (PR: we’re doing a pilot of that – although it’s too bad to use yet; they’re considering a private transatlantic link that should make it easier).
<li>MAKE IT WORK! (eg, 4 failures in last week: no e-mail for one week while traveling; couldn’t order “Clicks@Home” PC over the Web; a video conference with John Baxter and Nick Baldwin failed; couldn’t fill in the staff survey (crashed browser!))
<li>The [Group Director] group is fragmented (mixture of Westwood, London and US); not optimised for easy communication.
“I bump into people at random – you only communicate on the basis of need.” Better communication would allow engineering to be more involved in the discussion of corporate direction.
</ul>

<H2>Group function</H2>
<ul>
<li>Two main functions - Group engineering policy (helping to manage assets effectively) and Research.
</ul>
<H3>Group Engineering Policy</H3>
<ul>
<li>Carries out a regular review (“not quite an audit”) of the engineering assets <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> takes a “sideways look” at what’s going on, independently of line management.
<li>The aim is to set a structure for policy without being too prescriptive. They have a small number of prescriptive minimum engineering standards (eg, how to handle pulverised fuels), mostly around safety, and otherwise containing policy framework documents (advisory documentation – “almost a knowledge base”).
<li>John has appointed a new manager for this as part of his team; she is part of LG&E and is based in the US. She manages the process of policy production, and also the annual plant status  review process (sometimes funded by the business; sometimes funded by the group).
The master copies of policies should be available on the intranet (nearly there, if not actually there).
</ul>
<H3>Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chris runs this. He is the purchaser of R&D, and sets the themes for it. He has an R&D budget to spend; his largest supplier is the “Power Technology Centre” (PTC), which is part of Powergen (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> who runs that?). He also does technology tracking. Much of what they do is “very far from blue sky – it’s almost service activity that the assets won’t pay for.”
<li>Engineering R&D “underpins the necessary engineering expertise/competency within the company”. Can be bought in, but sometimes it needs to be in the business (eg, in order to provide expertise for litigation). Some (most) of it does this; some of it looks way into the future at things they think might be significant.
<li>External links are important (they provide a “technology window on the world”).  For example, <a href="http://www.epri.com" target=_new>EPRI</a> (US) and <a href="http://www.vgb-power.de" target=_new>VGB</a> (Germany) are professional bodies to which Powergen is affiliated. There is no real common model for dealing with external organisations – it depends on the organisation.
<li>There is a “sort of” rolling three-year R&D plan. The plan is reviewed annually, but R&D projects tend to be most effective when they last about three years. Thus, each year, Chris has to decide whether to allocate the next year of funding for each project that’s on-going, as well as starting new ones.
<li>There is a very large range of issues and technologies: The PTC has ~250 people, which roughly equates to 250 specialities.
<li>Businesses also do R&D, but they have a very short-term focus (it’s not often not quite “proper” R&D – more like technical service activity with a novel edge). Businesses will tend to act locally (by doing their own work or buying solutions) to solve their own business problems. Limited dialogue.
<li>Group engineering organises “one major brainstorming jamboree” per year in the US and the UK.
<li>Collaborative ventures are increasingly common. They reckon to achieve a 30% spending leverage on collaborative ventures (in fact 4:1 financial gearing; 10:1 IP gearing). Almost all collaborative activities are done at the corporate level. They are keen on them, but there are trade-offs that prevent them sometimes (commercial confidentiality; the sheer effort of bidding; the number of discussions that don’t get anywhere).
<li>All output documents from R&D available on the R&D intranet; can send e-mails with links to reports on it.
</ul>
<H2>Other Issues</H2>
<H3>Current R&D Intranet</H3>
<ul>
<li>Quite extensive (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> need to see it + what’s the CMS?);
<li>No access control (beyond standard Powergen security <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> issues with users from US at the moment).
<li>Contains policy master copies, R&D documentation, including the outputs of seminars (eg, the recent Louisville seminar on combustion) with presentations.
<li>CG concerned about storage requirements, and download times.
<li>Would like to be able to partition the site (some public information; some corporate only; some group only) <font face=symbol>&#174;</font> PR pointed out that you can do that already
<li>Would like an “easy route” for publishing documents to the site (currently done by shared PA Mary Mulligan).
</ul>
<H3>Reaction To Preparatory Questions</H3>
<ul>
<li>Thought the idea of putting personal objectives up to be “a bit strong”, although a fan of business objectives (on probing, agreed he was more concerned with “personal development”-type objectives).
<li>There are definitely issues of confidentiality (eg, a turbine failure in the US might involve challenging the manufacturer in court, which would require confidentiality).
<li>Wrt technology, observed that US managers had pagers to provide a certain level of connectivity. Perceived a danger in things like active memory and smart signs that it would cause “too much bureaucracy” (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> why?).
<li>Likes LG&E’s people directory with pictures, to allow you to put a face to the name (PR said “something similar” is being done here <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> get details of internal projects).
</ul>
