<H1>Nick Baldwin</H1>
<p>CEO, Powergen Group</p>
<p>Interviewed on 30/8/2001 at Westwood<br>
Present: Paul Rutter (Powergen); John Wilson and Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Personal</H2>

<ul>

<li>How to be available “in the sticks” in the US (eg, in rural Kentucky)?

<li>Mobile technology is important; connectivity everywhere is critical. Remote messaging must be secure.

<li>Doesn’t use corporate e-mail from home [just a matter of getting it working?] but uses personal e-mail.

<li>Has a computer like his Westwood one in his London office; has no office in US.

<li>“Every time we redesign [the intranet] some things get better and some things get worse.”

<li>Need to have quick wins; need deliverables (eg, 43% sign-up to “clicks@home”). Must have visible progress before Christmas (+ plenty before Windows XP due Dec 2002).

<li>[Check out how “ask Nick” site has gone – no idea at the time how popular it would be]

<li>How can we make “ask Nick” (ie, the CEO intranet) be more effective? Could be great, but must not be a burden on Nick.

</ul>

<H2>Relations with group directors</H2>
<ul>
<li>Ownership of the changes is in the business.
<li>Historic group is a dinosaur: the group directors are feeling left out, and are therefore difficult to engage. For example, it took “digital day” (borrowed from GE; a day when printers, photocopiers and fax machines are unavailable) for any comment (complaint) to be made.
<li>The group directors’ views of IT, historically, have been “mostly a hassle”. NB has led from the front, with open calendar, adoption of iPaq etc. “Others are following.”
<li>Currently, group directors work more independently than they will need to in future, when there will be a smaller corporate team with small TORs.
<li>Meetings can be inefficient: sometimes people don’t turn up with the latest versions of documents; or “I’m a picture person – we have a balanced scorecard for the business that I can read quickly. However, it’s in colour – and it prints in different colours on some peoples’ printers and in black and white on others’ [exasperated]”
</ul>

<H2>Group Function</H2>
<ul>
<li>Businesses spread out over the whole of Kentucky in the US (“Hicksville”); further mid-West acquisitions likely.
<li>The structure used to be centralised. Now it is a “utility conglomerate” <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> more devolution; more done in the businesses; need for group to demonstrate value.
<li>Another function of the group is to distribute best practice (cf. BP where they found their experts did not share).
<li>The group is there to be advisor, enabler and coach, not “doer” or commander
</ul>

<H2>Other Issues</H2>
<H3>E.ON</H3>
<ul>
<li>E.ON deal announced, but will not be completed for 12-14 months for regulatory reasons.
<li>98% of current staff are shareholders <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> impact on reporting. When Powergen becomes an E.ON subsidiary there will no longer be a publicly known share price.
<li>Culturally behind Powergen; traditionally, they operate in Germany only in monopolistic markets.
</ul>
