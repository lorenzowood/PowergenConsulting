<h1>Powergen group technology consulting project</h1>
<p>15th October 2001</p>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this short project, where we looked at how to get the Powergen Group working more effectively, we did the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Interviewed the Group directors</b> with a couple of exceptions, together with some of their PAs. The raw output of this exercise can be found under <a href=interviews.htm>Interviews</a>.
<li><b>Derived a set of broad, common issues</b> arising from these interviews. The issues can be found under <a href=issues.htm>Issues</a>, where you can also see from the <a href=issues.htm#mode=breakdown>breakdown</a> what evidence we had for these issues from the interviews.
<li>We then produced an <b>initial set of ideas</b> for things to address some of the issues and to improve working practices in the group. These can be found under <a href=ideas_full.htm>ideas</a>.
<li>To give the project momentum, we needed to put these ideas into a <b>framework</b> that the organisation can use as a handle on the project going forward. We created <a href=superconnectivity.htm>Super connectivity</a> to do this. <a href=superconnectivity.htm>Super connectivity</a> is set of principles that can be used both as a diagnostic and for planning purposes. In the <a href=ideas.htm>ideas</a> section, we have arranged the ideas under each of the principles for reference.
<li>Finally, we applied our process for <a href=buildingvalueinapeoplebusiness.htm>Building value in a people business</a> to the Powergen group, where we see that:<br>

We have begun successfully by engaging the most senior level of the group. To keep the momentum, we build on their stated wish to work effectively and collaboratively by providing them with individual benefits (the &#147;selfish participant&#148; part of <a href="buildingvalueinapeoplebusiness.htm">our process</a>), and then plan to move forward by first <i>strongly supporting</i> this change in working practices, and then by <i>measuring</i> it as well. In 12 months&#146; time, we suggest that (at least) directors&#146;s objectives should include targets for collaborative working.
