<H1>Rhonda Bonnie</H1>
<p>PA to David Jackson</p>
<p>Interviewed on 13/9/2001 at New Broad Street<br>
Present: Karen Inman (Powergen); Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Notes</H2>
<ul>
<li>80% of time on David’s diary
<ul>
<li>cancelling meetings, rescheduling meetings, cancelling meetings just rescheduled, rebooking them again.
<li>70% e-mail; 30% phone
<li>5% initiated by David
<li>(70%/30% internal (inc. US)/external)
</ul>
<li>20% phone calls, papers, <i>ad hoc</i> personal stuff; bit of typing from dictation/shorthand
<ul>
<li>eg, post – comes in addressed to David, but sent immediately to where it has go. 40 pieces of external of post per day; 10 bits of internal, of which he’ll see 30%;
</ul>
<li>Shared to access to inbox:
<ul>
<li>Highlights important messages (verbally, on the phone, forward from Rhonda with “IMPORTANT” written on it);
<li>David forwards with instructions.
</ul>
<li>Personal stuff:
<ul>
<li>travel arrangements;
<li>helping with moving house;
<li>holidays;
<li>private car stuff.
</ul>
<li>Do expenses; sickness report; accidents etc. (for whole department)
<li>Incoming invoices; signing off expenses for those who report to David:
<ul>
<li>home phone bills;
<li>cars;
<li>newspapers etc.
</ul>
<li>Childcare vouchers (tiny amount)
<li>(In Notes – when you look at shared e-mails, can you see what the director has read (as opposed to what you have read)? – check)
<li>David’s diary is not electronic – it’s too quick to do it electronically. Can’t do notes neatly. Can’t see things that are now cancelled but were there. Electronic diary updated weekly as a rough record.
<li>Training and internal knowledge - “If I wanted to do a PowerPoint advanced course, I would just ring the lady and she’d come down”
<li>However, it’s not clear what’s on the intranet – I’ve been asking about lots of things and I’m told they’re on the Intranet. The intranet isn’t very user friendly; it’s hard to navigate.
<li>What could David benefit from?
<ul>
<li>Being more IT literate
<li>Making his schedule pop up immediately when he turns on his computer
<li>(How can he get time for training?)
<li>Complains that he can’t get into the networks (from US) when they’re backing up in the UK. </ul>
<li>Misses Rhonda when she’s not in (eg, late)
<li>Leaves lots of voicemails
<li>Handle distribution of results to other places;
<li>Can see company inboxes (uses Company Secretary address remotely because the other one’s too full) but doesn't share his home inbox or Hotmail one.
</ul>
