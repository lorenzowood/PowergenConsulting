<H1>David Jackson</H1>
<p>Company secretary</p>
<p>Interviewed on 6/9/2001 at New Broad Street<br>
Present: Paul Rutter (Powergen); John Wilson and Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Personal</H2>

<ul>
<li>Typical week: 2/3 days in London, 2/3 days in Coventry (office and computer in each); one day somewhere else (eg, Dusseldorf) w/o laptop; ½ day at home in Oxfordshire (PA e-mails things home).
<li>Also goes to US for 3/4 days at a time, taking a laptop in this case.
<li>Doesn’t have any password on laptop(!)
<li>Has two Powergen e-mail addresses (david.jackson@pgen.com and company.secretary@pgen.com), plus a Hotmail account and a home e-mail address.
<li>Tends to use the company secretary one remotely in order to avoid having to download unwanted long documents.
<li>Sits in cars a lot <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> uses a dictation machine, and feeds tapes to PA
<li>Nirvana: voice recognition (avoid the PA step in the dictation) [Why? 24-hour availability; turnaround; but would be less smart(?)]
<li>Would only go to a training course if it addressed his individual needs.
<li>Uses mobile phone for reminders, phone book etc. Even though it’s a tri-band [Nokia 8890 probably] it doesn’t work properly in Cincinnati.
<li>Uses e-mail as a matter of course; doesn’t go into the intranet in the same way.
<li>Never reads a manual.
<li>“Better to have something simple that works, rather than something sexy and unreliable.”
<li>“Happy” with the Internet; logs on from home; uses search engines; Tesco on line etc.
<li>Likes yellow legal pads; used to carry a paper book but worried about losing it.
<li>Intranet is cluttered; hardly use it now; really needs to read press cuttings, but electronic version too difficult.
</ul>

<H2>Relations with group directors</H2>
<ul>
<li>The multiple sites are a pain. The 120 miles to Coventry and the 70 miles to Nottingham are, in some ways, “further than the 3,000 miles across the Atlantic.”
<li>The London office works well because “we can walk into other people’s offices for a chat.” Having half the team at Westwood prevents this.
<li>Telephones and conference calls work really well (case: when doing the final filings for the LG&E acquisition they did it with a 10.5hr all-lawyer conference call involving e-mail and fax – “Bloody marvellous! Couldn’t have done it without [all of these technologies]”
<li>Videoconferencing is “OK”, but not much good for “a four-hour… set-piece meeting”.
<li>“E-mail is just a letter.” If you send a fax to someone at Westwood it arrives by e-mail anyway <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> isn’t differentiated. 
<li>Need etiquette for e-mail.
<li>“Sometimes it’s good to send a memo because… it’s important and [people] need to read it [physically].”
<li>Group CEO (Nick Baldwin) has been in place for seven months; head of US business (Vic Staffieri) has been in place since May [four months?]; head of UK business (Paul Golby) has been in place for only two months <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> three teams learning to live with each other.
<li>The directors also have to live and work with each other.
<li>So, how can “we spend some quality time [eg, once a week] together?”
<li>The Germans have “Verschaft”; “we run around like blue-arsed flies.”
</ul>

<H2>Group function</H2>
<ul>
<li>“We need a culture of communication; that means we listen, we hear and we speak. Now, we have a culture of sending information.”
<li>“A culture of trust requires two-way communication and commitment delivery. IT must support such a culture, not be a substitute for one.”
<li>The Powergen way is “do do do do think do.”
</ul>
