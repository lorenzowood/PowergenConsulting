<H1>John Hart</H1>
<p>Group Director, HR</p>
<p>Interviewed on 30/8/2001 at Westwood<br>
Present: Paul Rutter (Powergen); John Wilson and Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>
<H2>Personal</H2>

<ul>
<li>Needs a database on everyone in the company (mostly managers).
<li>Need good, reliable mobile communications.
</ul>


<H2>Relations with group directors</H2>
<ul>
<li>Having a “lean and mean” group requires stronger relationships. Relationships are critical.
</ul>
<H2>Group Function</H2>
<ul>
<li>&#147;To look exclusively at the group rather than at the group + the function is wrong.&#148;
<li>“We haven’t yet recognised the inefficiencies of how we use the technology”
<li>The process of working out how to work together better should be done collaboratively.
<li>We should be behaviourally led, not technologically led. Staff commitment is not automatic – we must not do what Bob Ayling did [at British Airways].
</ul>

<H3>&#147;Virtual HR&#148;</H3>
<ul>
<li>“What I need to deliver with a team of six I cannot deliver without the cooperation of the businesses.”
<li>Principles of vHR: removal of duplication; accountability at the point of capability; self-service information maintenance.
<li>“[We have a culture of] information hiding because people do not want to be second-guessed. Information is a corporate asset.”
<li>Using/going to use [which?] Rebus (see <a href=http://www.rebushr.com target=_new>http://www.rebushr.com</a>)
<li>“How do you build infrastructure that doesn’t impede educational change?”
<li>Group HR develops products/services (as opposed to functional support [meaning what?]); once a product or service has become a commodity, buy it in <font face=symbol>&#222;</font>“I can envisage a situation where no HR services are provided by the company [but it will need technology to provide access to the bought-in services]”
<li>[Group HR therefore] provides “heavy hitting” stuff such as change management.
</ul>
<H3>M&A</H3>
<ul>
<li>Need to make sure that the resources exist to handle a proposed M&A (hence the need for a database). Need to know we can deliver sufficient resources with the right skills at the right time [at “the drop of a hat” – see <a href="Caroline_Sheers.htm">Caroline Sheers interview</a>].
</ul>
<H3>Succession Planning</H3>
<ul>
<li>Need information about the needs of succession planning (local vs. HR) [meaning?]
<li>Need the ability to challenge the businesses on the experience of their [human(!)] stock. For example: “Is your succession plan adequate?” “Can you facilitate the development of X in Y way?”
</ul>
<H3>Adoption & Training</H3>
<ul>
<li>Ego vs. training: not “I can’t use this…” but “I don’t use this, because…”. How much do people know about the things that they can do already?
</ul>
<H2>Other Issues</H2>
<H3>Internal Communications</H3>
<ul>
<li>“Are we satisfied that the communication processes we are using are capturing the imagination of everyone in the company?”
<li>The concepts are not obvious (what about communicating them?)
<li>Bricks’n’Clicks CD-ROM was “superficial and not exciting”.
<li>“How are we getting everyone to understand the same concept?”
</ul>
<H3>Email</H3>
<ul>
<li>Powergen needs e-mail etiquette
</ul>
<H3>Coaching</H3>
<ul>
<li>We use this word a lot; what do we mean by it? What do the businesses think?
<li>JH to pick up defining buzzwords (eg, “merger of equals” – referring to Powergen/LG&E – resulted in broken promises).
</ul>
