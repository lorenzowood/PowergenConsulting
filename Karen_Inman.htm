<p>PA to Chris Salame and Sarah Vaughan</p>
<p>Interviewed on 13/9/2001 at Westwood<br>
Present: Rhonda Bonnie (Powergen); Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Notes</H2>
<ul>
<li>For Sara: all work is “straight PA” work
<li>For Chris:
<ul>
<li>30% secretarial; 70% administration
<li>Secretarial:
<ul>
<li>Diary;
<li>Post;
<li>Answering telephone from other people (eg, “has he looked at X?”) (point of contact).
<li>Lots of calls from shareholders (any size); often deals with questions directly.
<li>Post from shareholders – liase with registrars (“Computershare Investor Services”).
<li>Covers for Rhonda;
<li>Supervises temps;
<li>Lots of template letters for shareholder correspondence
<li>Shared inboxes.
<li>Administer electronic diaries.
</ul>
<li>Administration:
<ul>
<li>“Blueprint” inputting of data.
<li>Database of company registration information (eg, directors etc.).
<li>Taken over basic administration of it (+2 other people also look at it).
<li>Can print off company returns.
<li>Maintain an archive system of departmental filing (write in a book – a database would be a nice idea). Consulted maybe once a week.
<ul>
<li>What sort of thing? Company minutes etc.
<li>Would be worth scanning them? Yes.
</ul>
<li>Trying to get back annual reports and regulatory accounts put on the Web site so we can get rid of our archive copies and point people at the Web site (or print off it).
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Would like to get more involved with projects. Eg, Diane (ShareSave and profit sharing); getting “in on the ground floor” with what is happening. I often get involved with things later (at Sara’s level); having visibility lower down would make it possible to give a better service.
<li>[Chris and Sara] experience laptop problems regularly;
<li>Training is available but is seldom used;
</ul>
