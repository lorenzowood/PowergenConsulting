<H1>Jonathan Hodgkin</H1>
<p>Group Director, Strategy</p>
<p>Interviewed on 30/8/2001 at Westwood<br>
Present: Paul Rutter (Powergen); John Wilson and Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Personal</H2>

<ul>

<li>In UK business we share objectives, but not performance; in the group we don’t even publish/share objectives.

</ul>

<H2>Relations with group directors</H2>
<ul>
<li>Wants “a close-knit team” in the group; doesn’t have this at the moment.
<li>Needs to make more cohesive and effective communication within the group, and to make the right interactions with the businesses (and make those valuable). For example, it’s not easy casually to discuss an M&A possibility within the whole group. M&A, Finance and legal, both being in London, will all discuss. We need “a level of communication and cohesion beyond [the] strictly necessary.”
<li>The group should be together, and it should not be co-located within the UK business. The US is a big issue in this – it will grow much faster (particularly with E.ON); could end up with a split UK/US site and/or US “imports” (eg, John Baxter’s US manager).
<li>Personally: with Nick Baldwin; with MDs of US and UK (largely UK – need to address this bias); Carol Wood; Caroline Shears. Little contact with John Hart or David Jackson.
<li>I see enormous value in this team working together”
<li>People don’t want not to communicate, but they don’t see the value in doing so, “except where necessary.”
</ul>
<H2>Group Function</H2>
<ul>
<li>Trying to introduce clarity: three years ago, 95% of the business was a single generation business. Now there’s a parent (which must add value), and UK and US businesses; BUT initial creation of parent/corporate team very unclear, because the parent has the same name/branding as the UK retail business, is co-located with it and therefore is unhealthily close.
<li>One role of the parent is to manage the transfer of expertise (eg, about working in a deregulating market) to (eg,) the US.
<li>Nick’s memo to the “leadership group” (“top 30”) [who are they?] [can we have the memo – ref. NPB701/016 10/8/2001].
<li>Distinction between hands-on involvement in processes and processes that the group facilitates and incentivises (eg, through performance management).
<li>Need to identify where the parent actually can add value (and stop it doing things where it can’t).
<li>Where does the group add value? John Baxter/Chris Green good example. They’ve gone round being useful with knowledge transfer (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> have spent time in the US performing a connection role; NB John Baxter has recent management knowledge, because until recently he had an operational leadership role). John has made the effort to go and build personal relationships <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> having the “easy” operational management job taken away has forced him to decide what use he can be. [In response to question from PR: not sure how those operational connections can be made when the operational roles weren’t there before]
<li>Centre has a remit to facilitate the sharing of expertise, but detailed plans have to be developed by the people who will execute them.
<li>The parent should be freeing up time for the business leaders to focus on their businesses; it should focus on getting the split of opportunities right.
<li>In this “parenting” role the scope for people to misunderstand and get annoyed/disillusioned is very high. How about an intranet for the “top 30”? (NB technical/logistical issues have made it impossible to date) – cf. e-procurement, which is done on an external ASP-type site; not ideal, but up.
<li>Example: We [strategy] think that group HR may be very different from what John thinks, but we haven’t had his input because of “a cultural issue about a desire to communicate with colleagues” [In response to “can HR support this change?”: “I have personal views about their ability to do so.”]
<li>Possible organisation: along value processes – eg, changing the portfolio; maximising the value of the portfolio; managing the risk of the portfolio. All of these are inherently multi-disciplinary.
<li>Timetable: 10/9 Process + organisation options to Nick; 20/9 Nick gives answer [so, what was it?]; 30/9 decision finalised; 15/10 half a day on what the parent will end up looking like.
