<H1>Carol Wood</H1>
<p>Group Director, Planning & Performance Management</p>
<p>Interviewed on 30/8/2001 at Westwood<br>
Present: Paul Rutter (Powergen); John Wilson and Lorenzo Wood (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Personal</H2>

<ul>
<li>“There is no substitute for personal contact; I don’t want any solutions that involve not meeting people.”
<li>“[I want] technology to unburden me of the rest of the crap.”
<li>Needs mobile working. “If I’m travelling I need to do work <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> I need my whole PC”
<li>Typical problem: “I’m in my hotel room trying to download one e-mail and I end up waiting for hours, and then the link times out at 3am etc. etc.”
</ul>

<H2>Relations with group directors</H2>
<ul>
<li>I think Group Directors should spend half their time (ie, two weeks a month) in the US.
</ul>

<H2>Group Function</H2>
<H3>Planning</H3>
<ul>
<li>Project manages the planning process for the group, liasing with the CEO and FD at Group level, and the US and UK heads of the businesses and their respective finance teams <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> well-defined technical need for (eg,) data consolidation.
</ul>
<H3>Performance Management</H3>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing implementation of performance management – to some degree, making sure we’re doing properly what we’ve already agreed to do (eg, group performance report goes to board).
<li>Would like “technology to unburden [her] of the rest of the crap.”
<li>Currently people send stuff in as documents – could do with some sort of “fill in the blanks” site for reporting.
<li>In the “parenting” model, costs must be low <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> small teams <font face=symbol>&#222;</font> “work” bit must be very successful.
<li>Not yet sure what the performance metrics for the group should be; need to focus on them to make ourselves more accountable. Even heads of businesses don’t necessarily appreciate the value – it is felt locally, but not at that [high] level.
<li>Introducing a corporate centre performance report that goes to the executive once a quarter.
<li>Trouble is that there’s no overview. For example, an M&A occurring will be reported (separately) in the tax report, the HR report, the legal report etc. Given the structure, this is necessary, but it makes it look like self-justification. Shrinking the corporate centre may help with this, because with a lower density of activity the communication would be more focused (eg, around the M&A transaction, demonstrating performance against targets for the various functions).
<li>Currently a lot of data flow is business <font face=symbol>&#174;</font> centre – the centre is not so good at sharing. Very few see the performance report, and so cannot comment on findings within it. Ideally, more should be shared with the “top team” of 30 people. At the moment they don’t get to see what their input helps to make (<font face=symbol>&#222;</font> lack of personal satisfaction, both by those supplying the content and Carol and her team who make the report); they don’t get to see “the big picture”. For example, Carol’s report contains, among other things, the top 10 risks for the business – all of the “top 30” should know them.
<li>People perceive the things that have to go to the centre (eg, investment decisions) as bureaucratic (eg, “[If] I give procedure X to the UK business, then they should communicate it. If they don’t, but just “overlay” it on their own plans, it looks like “it’s all the group’s fault.”)
</ul>
<H3>Evolution Of Processes</H3>
<ul>
<li>Monthly reporting does evolve (eg, as Powergen becomes a truly Anglo-American organisation), but timescales are so short that there’s not much time for discussion.
<li>Annual planning: there is more opportunity for creativity because the timescales are more relaxed.
</ul>
<H3>Other Issues</H3>
<ul>
<li>Three types of user suggested - Mobile phone (Peter H, Jonathan Hodgkin), mobile + email + document review (Nick Baldwin, David Jackson), mobile phone + full computing environment (Carol Wood, Caroline Shears, Maureen Vevers)
</ul>
