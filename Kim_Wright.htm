<H1>Kim Wright</H1>
<p>PA to Nick Baldwin</p>
<p>Interviewed on 13/9/2001 at Westwood<br>
Present: John Wilson (Oyster)</p>

<H2>Notes</H2>
<ul>
<li>New to Powergen and came from job as PA to MD of a computer software firm;
<li>Used to technology adoption and therefore finds Powergen environment quite backward;
<li>Despite Nick's take-up of technology she still has a very large traditional diary with lots of to-do and reminder stickers (she misses Outlook). She also has to deal with a lot of paper in terms of various packages that Nick can read in taxis, cars, planes etc. 
<li>She believes that Nick needs a combination of laptop and iPaq so that she can get him access to full function and attachments (iPaq implementation does not currently allow attachments).
<li>Additionally, board papers are created and distributed digitally but then in the couple of days leading up to, and including, the actual meeting PAs are queuing up at colour printers waiting for multiple copies of the papers to be printed for the various directors.
<li>Kim has run one PA Foundation Group where they got to know each other. 
<li>She indicated that there was a mix of old and young, interested and not interested in technology. Lack of knowledge and training was evident and many felt that even if they adopted technology then there directors probably would not (my assessment here was that the PAs, not surprisingly, are taking the lead from their particular Director);
<li>Kim is trying to set up an intranet for PAs with minutes of these meetings and other &#145;stuff&#146; of interest but is having trouble getting IT to deliver despite the fact that an IT person was included in the PA meeting. This seems to be a recurring theme &#151; lots of planning, strategy and talk but not so much action. 
<li>She is working with Windows 95 and would like 2000 or XP immediately for Outlook and support of her HP 95G (copier, scanner, printer) which currently she can only use as stand-alone copier and printer ie, cannot create PDFs from scanned docs, can create word docs but her PC runs out of memory and even then the machine cannot be connected to Powergen network.
