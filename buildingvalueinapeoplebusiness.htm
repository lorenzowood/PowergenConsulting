<h2>Building value in a people business</h2>
<p>Below we describe briefly our approach to building value in people businesses, which we have developed in the context of rolling out, and generating return on investment from, technology solutions in businesses.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We start with the premise, shown in the diagram below, that we must build our value from the individuals upwards, since they traditionally hold the true value — knowledge and relationships in particular — of a business.</p>
<img src=img/bviapb_overview.gif width=504 height=193 vspace=10><br>
<p>We need the cooperation of the individual professionals in the businesses. With the best will in the world, however, we find that people are:
<ul><li>Focused on their own performance
<li>Busy
<li>Sceptical
<li>Cynical
</ul>
We therefore need a process to engage these people and obtain their cooperation and trust.</p>
<h3>Laying the foundation</h3>
<p>We begin at the individual level, taking the professionals in the business through the stages shown below:<br>

By focusing on their individual needs, we eliminate the initial barriers to cooperation. As we move through the process, we convince them of the benefits of it so that the individuals become willing participants who will “pay to play” and, eventually, will drive the development of new services and ways of working, rather than merely enthusiastically consuming those that they are offered.</p>
<h3>Building the infrastructure</h3>
<p>Alongside the process with individuals, we also address the way in which to deliver the services most effectively.</p>
<img src=img/bviapb_infrastructure.gif width=567 height=228 vspace=10>
<p>Our approach is, essentially, to “fake it”. Where possible, rather than spend a lot of time and money up front worrying about scalability and efficiency, we concentrate on small groups and on delivering what the users want to their desktops. Note that this is not the same as building “mock ups” &#151; these services must actually work and deliver value to the users. The idea is to create pull from the bottom up in an organisation.</p>
