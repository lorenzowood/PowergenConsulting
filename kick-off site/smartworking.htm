<h1>Smart working</h1>
<p>Below are some ideas for “smart working”, all of which have been used effectively to create small networked (rather than hierarchical) groups of people that are able together to make best use of their abilities. Some are technology-based and some are organisational. </p>
<p>At this stage, we have kept the content here short and to the point in advance of the meetings. Feel free to <a href="mailto:lorenzo@oyster.com">comment</a> on them, or to ask about them/give your views in the meetings.</p>

<a name="accessibility"></a><h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>If your calendar shows you to be free, you should be accessible to your colleagues – for example, if someone wants to chat about a piece of work or an idea. The principle is that you should need a good reason not to have a meeting, rather than needing to justify a meeting in advance.</p>
<p>This promotes a culture of trust and of the exchange of ideas by shifting the “burden of proof”.
</p>
<a name="activebadges"></a><h2>Active badges</h2>
<p>An active badge is a small electronic device, worn as a badge (it has your name on it), that uses wireless technology to communicate with a network as you move around your building. This communication enables you to be located and this information to be shared with others.</p>
<p>Active badges make people easier to find, and also help provide context for appropriate communication (eg, if I can see you are in a meeting with several people I will not call you). They are also helpful for supporting services such as “<a href="#activememory">active memory</a>”.</p>

<a name="activememory"></a><h2>Active memory</h2>
<p>This involves using technology to help you to remember things that, at the time, you didn’t know you needed to remember. An example of active memory techniques is routine and automatic recording (audio or audio/video) of meetings. When indexed with meeting room calendar records or timestamped notes taken on a PDA (or logs from “<a href="#activebadges">active badges</a>”), these recordings help you to remember detail in the common scenario of “I was talking to Bob about something like this last week.”</p>
<p>Active memory reduces the burden of record keeping by moving it into the infrastructure of the workplace, encouraging freer and more nimble interaction.</p>

<a name="opencalendars"></a><h2>Open calendars</h2>
<p>Everyone must use an electronic calendar to schedule appointments. The contents of this calendar are visible to everyone. This does not preclude individual appointments being private.</p>
<p>As well as making it easier to find people, this raises of awareness of what others are doing, promoting useful dialogue.</p>

<a name="smartsigns"></a><h2>Smart signs</h2>
<p>Smart signs are small, flat colour screens used instead of name plates on offices or meeting room doors. They are used to communicate the status of the room (or the occupant). For example, a meeting room’s smart sign shows what meeting is currently taking place and an indication of when the room is free during the day. An individual’s smart sign might give information about that individual’s current activity or objectives. Smart signs can be interactive – for example, you can “grab” an empty room by touching a button on the sign – and are networked.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious practical benefit of being able more easily to coordinate use of space, smart signs also provide another channel of communication in the communal work space.</p>

<a name="visibleobjectives"></a><h2>Visible objectives</h2>
<p>Everyone should have individual objectives that are visible to everyone in the company. They should also maintain this information by giving updates of progress towards these objectives.</p>
<p>This raises awareness of what others are doing, and also promotes a culture of success and collaboration.</p>

<a name="wirelesslan"></a><h2>Wireless LAN</h2>
<p>Your desktop computer is connected to your office local area network (LAN) with a cable. A low-cost wireless version of this technology is available.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding security issues, using a wireless LAN enables mobile devices such as PDAs to be permanently connected to the network, and also allows more flexible arrangements (eg, you can pick up your laptop and meet a colleague for a coffee and still have access to your work to discuss).
