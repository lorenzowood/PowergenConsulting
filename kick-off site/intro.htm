<h1>Powergen group technology consulting project</h1>
<P>28th August 2001</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Over the next month, this project will look at ways in which the Internet and related technologies can best be used to help the new Powergen group work most effectively. This Web site will be used to present the final results of the project and, while it is running, to communicate progress to the group.</p>
<p>The first stage of the project is for us to meet briefly with most of the group directors. These meetings have been arranged over the next two weeks. It would be helpful if you can think about the questions on this page in advance of the meeting.
</p>
<p>Our approach to the project has been to define a “straw man” picture of how the new group can work. The site also contains a short explanation of this together with some background material; it will also help if you can review this, although it is not necessary. It should not take more than 20 minutes to do so.

<p>
In our meeting, we would like briefly to explain our “<a href="strawman.htm">straw man</a>” picture of how the new group can work, and then to listen to and discuss your reactions to it. Thinking in advance about the questions below will help you to prepare for this exercise.
<ol>
<li>Which of the following statements is most accurate for you:<ul>
	<li>I am enthusiastic user and adopter of new technology, and actively research it on my own.
	<li>I like to have the latest technology provided for me so that I can do my work most effectively.
	<li>The technology I use is largely good enough; I need to see strong evidence of value before I will change what I use.
	<li>I mostly avoid using technology directly; I work more effectively with and through my assistant and team.</ul>
<br><li>One idea for “<a href="smartworking.htm">smart working</a>” is that individual objectives, and current progress towards them, should be visible to everyone in the company. What is your reaction to this idea in the context of the Powergen group? How might it help effective working? In the background material you will find some <a href="smartworking.htm">other ideas</a>.
<br><br><li>How would you like your area of the Powergen group to be perceived by the rest of the businesses? What dialogues do you currently have with the businesses? How will this change in the future?
<br><br><li>Which of the following statements is most accurate for you:<ul>
	<li>I am an enthusiastic user of mobile technologies because they enable me to work at any time and anywhere, making me more responsive and allowing me to use my time better.
	<li>Mobile technologies are useful, but I am only interested in having those that are absolutely reliable because I do not want to waste my time working around their problems.
	<li>Mobile technologies are useful, but I am not convinced about their security to be able to use them for mission-critical work.
	<li>I think that mobile technologies, and the associated presumption of instant communication, detract from doing quality work by giving too much weight to comparatively trivial communications.</ul>
