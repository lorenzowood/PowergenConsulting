<h1>&#147;Straw man&#148;</h1>
<p>The “straw man” model is a way of describing the Powergen group for the purposes of discussing how it is organised and how we can exploit technology to help it be more effective. It is deliberately simple in approach.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the group</h2>
<p>We begin the description of the “straw man” by considering how the Powergen group is perceived to deliver value to the businesses. We chose:</ul>
	<li>Executing “big picture” strategy (adds value by working on a larger scale to any of the businesses)
	<li>Helping the businesses be more effective (adds value directly to the businesses)</ul></p>

<h2>“Straw man” picture</h2>
<p>In our sketch below, we represent the group, with the directors inside, as presenting a &#147;public face&#148; to the businesses.</p>
<p>In this project, we are looking at bringing tools and techniques (such as “<a href="smartworking.htm">smart working</a>”) into the group to help it work more effectively. To do this, we are taking a wider view that involves integrating dialogue with the businesses, through the public face, that communicates the value added by the group to the businesses and also provides feedback that helps the group with its activities.</p>
